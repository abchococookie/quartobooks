## Introduction
![](jama_lodestar_figs/jama_lodestar_summary.png)

## Introduction{.smaller}
#### Objective
- To assess whether a treat-to-target strategy is noninferior to a strategy of high-intensity statins for long-term clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease

#### Study Design
- Investigator-initiated, Open-label, Randomized, Multicenter, Noninferiority trial

#### Participants
- Patients with clinically diagnosed CAD

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Randomization and Study Procedures
- 1:1 randomized in treat-to-target strategy or high-intensity strategy group
- each group 1:1 randomized in rosuvastatin or atorvastatin

#### Randomization and Study Procedures
![](jama_lodestar_figs/jama_lodestar_fig1.png)

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Randomization and Study Procedures
- high or moderate intensity according to the guideline for the treatment of blood cholesterol
  - high: 20 mg of rosuvastatin or 40 mg of atrovastatin
  - moderate: 10 mg of rosuvastatin or 20 mg of atrovastatin
- target LDL-C level
  - treat-to-target group: below 70 mg/dL
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: true
df <- data.frame(
  uptitration = "70 mg/dL ~",
  maintenance = "50 mg/dL ~ 70 mg/dL",
  undertitration = "~ 50 mg/dL"
)
knitr::kable(df)
```
  - high-intensity group: maintenance of high-intensity statin therapy was recommended
- Non-statin add-on therapy was not recommended strongly
- other medical treatments allowed except for the change in the statin intensity

## Methods{.smaller}
- **Primary endpoint**: major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events defubed as a composite of all-cause death(cardiovascular or not), MI, stroke, and any coronary revascularization at 3 years

- **Secondary endpoint**
(1) occurance of new-onset diabetes
(2) hospitalization due to heart failure
(3) deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary thromnoemnolism
(4) endovascular revasculatization for perepheral artery disease

(5) aortic intervention or surgery

(7) discontinuation of study drugs due to intolerance
(8) cataract operation
(9) composite of laboratory abnormalities

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Sample Size Calculation
- expected event rate of the primary endpont at 3 years: 12% group
- NI margin of 3.0 %
- total 3686 patients was required with 2.5% one-sided alpha error rate and 80% power
- considering 15% loss => total of 4400 patients was required

## Methods{.smaller}
#### Statistical Analysis
1. **Kaplan-Meier curves** for a time-to-event analysis: cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint at 3 years
2. **Test of NI** for the primary endpoint using Com-Nougue approach to estimating the z statisticc for the Kaplan-Meier failure rates with the Greenwood formula for estimating the standard error
- perspecified subgroup analyses: performed for clinically relevant factors - age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabete, chronic kidney disease, clinical pesentation at radomization, baseline LDL-C levels

- in treat-to-target group
  - uptitrated in 17%, downtitrated in 9%m maintained in 73%
  - high-intensity statin at 1 year: 53%, at 2 years: 55%, at 3-years: 56%
- in high-intensity group
  - high-intensity statin at 1 year: 93%, at 2 years: 91%, at 3-years: 89%

- Ezetimibe: treat-to-target > high-intensity
  - mostly as a comnimation therapy with high-intensity statin therapy
- other cardiovascular medications were not statistically different

#### LDL-C level

### description
- 6 weeks: LDL-C level was significantly higher in the treat-to-target group than the high-intensity statin therapy group
- after 6 weeks: no significant difference
- overall period: no significant difference

#### LDL-C level
![etb7](jama_lodestar_figs/jama_lodestar_etb7.png)
- proportion of participants with LDL-C level below 70 mg/dL at 6 weeks and 3 months was significantly lower inthe treat-to-target group than the high-intensity group

## Results{.smaller}
#### Primary Endpoint
- primary endpoint occurred in 8.3% of treat-to-target group and 8.5% of high-intensity group
- difference upper CI was 1.5%, p <. 001 for NI

#### Secondary Endpoint
- no statistical difference
- post-hoc analysis: (1) new-onset diabetes (2) amino-transferase (3) creatine kinase elevation (4) end-stage kidney disease were significantly lower in the treat-to-target group

## Discussion{.smaller}
#### Limitations
1. open-label
2. lower event rates than anticipated
3. small num of events -> comparison of individual clinical outcomes within the primary endpoint was difficult
4. recruited exclusively patients with CAD -> other subsets of patients(e.g., prevention)
5. 60% of treat-to-target group achieved below 70mg/dL -> add-on therapy should be considered
6. 3 years -> relatively short to reflect longer-term effects of 2 strategies

## Discussion{.smaller}
#### Conclusion
- **treat-to-target LDL-C strategy of 50 to 70 mg/dL as the goal was NI to high-intensity statin therapy** for the 3 year composite of death, MI, stroke or coronary revascularization
